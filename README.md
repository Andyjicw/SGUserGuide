# SGUserGuide 

SGUserGuide is a framework for programmers to make steps to guide users, every step will restrict users to do a specific operation by adding masks to other regions. The framework can help you implement this without breaking the structure of the project based on AOP and KeyPath.

## A Simple Guide ScreenShot
You can implement a step just by creating an `SGGuideNode` object and add it to node list.
